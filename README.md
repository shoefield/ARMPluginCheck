# ARMPluginCheck
A broken, mostly useless script that outputs information regarding plugin (VST &amp; AU) architecture type. It basically spams the _find_ command recursively.

If anyone comes across this mess feel free to contribute in any way you can. AFAIK, a concept like this doesn't exist at the moment.

# To-Do
- [ ] Fix VST2 issue - probably something to do with _find_ or the _array_ not working correctly)
- [ ] Make log files more reader friendly - at the moment you'll have to search for **arm64**
- [ ] Clean up the code - I know it's ugly, but I've only recently started to learn bash...
